:computer: During the day I am a Front End Engineer at [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com).

ðŸŒ± If I a working on a side project these days it is usually this [Chord App](https://github.com/AntonEmery/chord-app). Its a full stack app using React/Node, that I would like to get deployed soon. I enjoy working on projects that are different from my day job where I can pick up new skills.

:brain: I write mostly Javascript/HTML/CSS. I can hack around in PHP a bit and am currently working on learning Rust
